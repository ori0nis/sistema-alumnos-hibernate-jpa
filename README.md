## Welcome to Sistema de Alumnos, a JPA + Hibernate web app! ðŸš€

Sistema de Alumnos is a simple management system where you can add, modify or delete students that are allocated in a SQL database.

This project is my first attempt at managing a database that has several tables. I wanted to dig a bit deeper into my Hibernate knowledge to fully grasp the way a backend deals with a database, and I decided to choose a servlet/JSP approach to increase my base knowledge of HTTP requests before I fully jump into Angular and React.

It also contains a few classes where I practiced with the different life cycle stages of the data.

_*Disclaimer:_ Unlike most of my previous projects, this one was created without an embedded server. As such, it requires deployment on your side.
